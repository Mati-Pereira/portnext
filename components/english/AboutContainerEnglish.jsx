      </h2>
      <p>Hello, how are you? My name is Matheus Rodrigues Pereira and I thank you for taking the time to look at this portfolio. I am 25 years old and currently unemployed. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from Universidade Vale do Rio Doce, in the year 2019, which is located in Governador Valadares, in the east of Minas Gerais. I did an internship as an Electric Panel Assembler.</p>
      <p>I currently live in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo.</p>
      <p>Programming has always been a passion of mine, since college, I always thought of connecting my knowledge with new technologies, it was and is something very instinctive to me. I dedicate myself heart and soul to achieve my dream of being a <em>Front-End</em> web developer.</p>
